# python-classification
A set of classical and machine learning classifiers using python libraries

## Algorithms
This classifier uses the scikit-neuralnetwork library. It implements three layers:

 * Tanh
 * Sigmoid
 * Softmax

The default parameters are a learning rate of 0.01 and a maximum number of iterations of 500.
